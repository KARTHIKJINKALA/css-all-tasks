    <p>Components of Embedded Systems
    Microcontroller/Microprocessor: The core computing unit, which executes the systemâ€™s software. Microcontrollers are often preferred in embedded systems due to their integrated peripherals and low power consumption.
    Memory: Includes both volatile memory (RAM) for temporary data storage and non-volatile memory (such as ROM, EEPROM, or flash) for storing firmware and persistent data.
    Input/Output Interfaces: Connectors and communication ports for interacting with external devices. These can include GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output), ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converters), DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converters), UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter), SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), and I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit).
    Software/Firmware: The programs and algorithms that run on the microcontroller, often written in languages like C or C++. This includes the operating system (if any), device drivers, and application-specific code.
